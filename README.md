# mathstuff
Some scripts I make to check my math homework. Most are super low-effort, one afternoon affairs.


Please let me know if there are issues in any script, I'd like to know!!

And I put an unlicense on this because this will be a super trivial repo. But if you find anything here useful, don't be shy,
gimme a shout! Likewise, if you "steal" anything I put here, super not recommended by the way since I'm basically a beginner,
I'd be happy if you acknowledge my repo somewhere - but it's a nice thing to do, not mandatory of course - that's why I'll be 
leaving this repo on the unlicense.

(And yeah, there's only one script here so far, deal with it. I've been procrastinating math homework after all.)


wordquestion.py - gives answer for questions like "How many n-letter words can you make with the letters of <word>?" 
                  simply supply the starting word and number of letters per word
                  it's single threaded, so do stupid stuff at your own risk.
